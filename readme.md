Hibernate mapping and query examples
====================================

Contains a number of different examples of Hibernate mappings and queries, such as:

 * Using a join formula to join on one of two columns
 * Accessing an index collection element in HQL
 * Using the "between" keyword
 * Converting join queries to correlated sub-queries
 * When flushing occurs
 * Using eager fetch
 * Using sum in a criteria query

The project is built using Maven, and sets up an HSQLDB to run. Hence, if you have maven installed, to run the examples just type:

    mvn test
